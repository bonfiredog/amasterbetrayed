# A Master Betrayed!
### A Web-Based, Cornish Murder Mystery(?)
----

##### 1760 in the small coastal town of Looe, South Cornwall. Robert Chester, a recent visitor to the town, is missing. His lodgings are in disarray, and witnesses report screams late on All Hallows Eve.
##### His servant - a local girl named Margaret Chester - has been arrested. She was found at her home with a silver locket taken from Chester's room, and a knife covered in blood. 
##### Apart from claiming that she is pregnant, she will say nothing.
##### Did she do it?

---

*A Master Betrayed!* is a web-based, interactive murder mystery in which you must query the evidence, hear the testimonies of local people and decide who is responsible for Chester's death. Though fictional, it draws on local archival material and workshops held with local residents, reflecting both past and present concerns at the heart of this community.

It is an adaptation of the [Arts Council-funded](http://artscouncil.org.uk) installation created by [Rob Sherman](http://bonfiredog.co.uk) and [Hugh McCann](http://hugh-mccann.com) for the [East Looe Old Gaol and Museum]() in 2022.
