<p>Longlegs,</p>

<p>I am so Sorry to only hear now; is it the sixth day sinse All Hallows Eve and here in Torpoint this breakfasttime I heard an Irishman (this is a man from Ireland, a place across the Water) speak of you. You would prick an Ear and laugh to hear what they say but I do not. And now I know whyfore I could not find the Lockett when I left that Night; all wrapt in a Cloth ready as a Present for you when we Reached the Inn. Is it a lovely thing my Velvett to love Beauty (Beauty is a kind of prettyness, the very Best sort); but what a <s>Complication</s> Fuss it has Caused us!</p>
    
<p>Perhaps your News shall even reach Virginia (I have told you of Virginia, and Williamsburg) before <s>I</s> we Shall; there is a Ship callt the Hannah which leaves for Ireland (I have told you of Ireland above) tomorrow on the Full Moon, and it is the last Crossing of the Season; & I must think of Mary & George, with my purse is nearing Empty here, & Mr. Winslow's charity e'en Emptier (Charity is a sort of love for your fellow Christian my Velvett). You shall understand that I cannot pay any Bail (Bail is a sort of rent to keap a Person from the Gaol), not e'en anonymously (this means without them knowing it was me) as they do not Allow it for Murder. Nor can I shew myself there now for it should kill poor Mary dead and despite everything she is a good Wife and as a Christian man I cannot do it. You shall know that I cannot do it.</p>

<p>You have been so Clever and Faithfull to me; for to claim you are with Child shall give us a Little Time. Have I thought on it all this Night gone (I have not Slept for it); and took to my Bible which I know shall have you laughing even now; I have dreamed only of your loud Laugh this week long waiting for You; and God forgive me but did I love to stand in the stuff and damp of that dining Room that Night and <s>pantomime</s> pre-tend to Die with you; watching your Throat move like a Bucket up a Well as you Scream'd and Smil'd at me; so keap that Smile and know that if I take the Hannah on the morning I shall have a House for us in Williamsburg within Three Month just as you Askt for it; then <s>Instruckt</s> pay for a Lawyer to meet with you at Bodmin. A Lawyer is a sort of man who shall Save you; and before Long you shall be coursing home to me across that Sea; to a house Warm with Fire and Food; new Names; a new Lockett if you Wish it; Rings; Hams; books if they still Please you. What was that Rhyme you Taught to me; may you Sing it even now and think of America still.</p>

<p>You came on so very Well with your Reading and Writing my Velvett and the Pracktise of them, een if we never did Finish; so I know that you shall Finish with this Note Quick; and when you have must I Beg you to shew it to Noone and swallow it down. It is only a Little Paper; and do you remember when I bought you that Chestnut at the Market and you ate it in a Thrice; Butter, Paper, Skin and all</p>

<p>Your Warren</p>

    <p>Serjeant,</p>
    <p>I trust your return to London was not too Onerous; I had heard the weather has been Foul West of Winchester this past Week. I En-close a Letter that has come to me at my Offices just Ahead of your Own; sent to me by Lady Chester who had it of Sir Henry Johns (the Judge at the Bodmin Assize).</p>
    <p>The note sent along with it tells that it was taken off a young boy who had come to visit with the Accus'd in the Gaol at Looe: he was found trying to Pass it to the Girl through the Bars. When question'd he came to tell that a Short man who went by a <strong>Mr. Warren</strong> Propositioned him in a public House (The Trap & Hound) near to Plymouth town; and paid him three Shilling to have it into Miss Thomas' hands and return to him any Reply. We were lucky the fellow Em-ployed the most Honest Urchin in all Cornwal.</p>
    <p>I trust this shall reach you at your Lodgings before we Meet next Week; and that you shall Attend me Sooner.</p>
    <p>Yours &c.</p>
    <p>William Moreton, Recorder Of London</p>
